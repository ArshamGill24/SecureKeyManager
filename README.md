# SecureKeyManager
## Description
Secure Key Manager is a robust application developed during my internship at Siber Koza. The project focuses on secure generation, encryption, and storage of cryptographic keys, along with facilitating secure serial communication between hardware devices (e.g., Arduino) and computers.
It is built using the C# .NET Framework and is designed to ensure data integrity and confidentiality during device communications.

## Key Features
Secure key generation and management

Data encryption and decryption using industry-standard cryptographic techniques

UART-based serial communication handling

User-friendly GUI for managing keys and settings

Basic logging for audit and traceability

Emphasis on secure practices during data transmission

## Technologies Used
C# .NET Framework

Windows Forms

Cryptography (AES, RSA)

Arduino UART Communication

## Note
For security reasons, the full code is not published publicly.
